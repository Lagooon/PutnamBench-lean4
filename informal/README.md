The informal statement information is encapsulated in json files indicating batches of problems.

Remember that when writing $\LaTeX$ within a JSON string, you must escape backslashes;
that is, you must write:
```json
"informal_statement": "What is the cardinality of $\\frac{1}{2} \\pm 1 \\pm 2$"
```
